# Project Narrative

In this project, Team Butterfly Bandits decided to make an application that takes user input, stores it to local storage, and displays data on the page. We decided to make a weather app that usees a users current location to give them their current weather, and a 5-day forecast. We also decided to implement a feature that displays the next 5 upcoming Holidays around the world. Both of these features required us to get our hands dirty with API's. We were able to get all of the information we needed out of the Open Weather Map API, but the Nager.Date API we used for the Holiday's was limited on what information we could get out of it. This lead us to chain mulitple fetch requests to each other in order to obtain the data we were looking for. This project is currently in an MVP state and we have tons of ideas for the future of this application.
